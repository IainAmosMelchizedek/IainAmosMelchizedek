🎓 **Graduate of Northeastern University (Boston, MA) — M.S. in Computer Science with a focus on Data Analytics, AI, and IT**

⚖️ **Undergraduate degree in Pre-Law from Lake Superior State University — foundation in logic, research, and critical analysis**

🔍 **Currently exploring data mining, machine learning, and Linux systems as part of building sovereign, intelligent infrastructures for small business owners who recognize that their data is theirs to control. Not Government. Not Big Tech.**

🛡️ **Mission: Keep Big Tech and Government out of the business of Small Businesses**

## 📌 About Me

🌱 I’m passionate about using data to uncover uncomfortable insights, drive insight, and solve real-world problems. Through my work, I’ve observed how government agencies exploit citizen data for political leverage, and how Big Tech extracts business intelligence from small business users—only to repackage and sell it back. That’s not innovation. That’s exploitation.

💻 I specialize in predictive modeling, data visualization, and automation—building tools that empower, not extract. 

🧘‍♂️ I’m especially interested in working with datasets related to **spirituality**, **animal behavior**, and **ethical systems design.**  

🛡️ I’m the founder of **Safe Passage Strategies, LLC**, a consultancy helping small businesses reclaim control of their data and build sovereign infrastructure free from Big Tech overreach. I’m also a vocal advocate for keeping government out of small business operations—data, decisions, and direction.

## 🌟 Extended Description

I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, with a focus on ethical, human-centered data strategy.

My journey into data science began with legal survival in mind. In 2023, I was wrongfully accused by officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) of committing a data breach after I disclosed to senior leadership—including Elizabeth Warren and Mitchell Kent—that CFPB management was collecting consumer data for political purposes during compliance reviews at depository and non-depository institutions.

While serving as an examiner, I accessed substantial internal data involving complaints from institutions under CFPB scrutiny and observed a disturbing trend: disproportionate scrutiny was being applied to institutions aligned with conservative or Republican ideologies. This confirmed longstanding concerns about political weaponization inside the CFPB—an agency founded by figures like Elizabeth Warren and Richard Cordray, whose public reputations conceal deeper ethical issues.

Importantly, there is no safe, protected channel for federal employees to whistleblow against federal agencies that brand themselves as watchdogs. I had no institutional recourse.

With a pre-law undergraduate degree, I made the strategic decision to pursue a Master’s in Data Analytics so I could defend myself using legal and technical precision. Ironically, the very agency that accused me failed to understand what constitutes a data breach. In sworn testimony on June 13, 2023 (U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs) and June 14, 2023 (House Financial Services Committee), CFPB Director Rohit Chopra confirmed under oath that no personally identifiable information—no names, Social Security numbers, or dates of birth—was disclosed. These are the core elements required to meet the legal definition of a breach.

Despite branding me an "Insider Threat," the Department of Justice declined to prosecute the case—acknowledging the baselessness of the claims. I now wear that title with pride. I exposed uncomfortable insights  against a US federal agency that exploits the very public it claims to protect. This is one of many reasons why the CFPB is now facing defunding and structural reform. 

Today, I apply advanced analytics to help small businesses defend themselves from similar overreach—whether by Big Tech or government. My story is not just personal; it’s a case study in how data, law, and ethics intersect in the real world. Technology didn’t just shape my career—it helped me survive against false accusations from government institutions.

One day, this story may become something like *Burn After Reading*: a dark satire of institutional incompetence. But until then, I’m focused on building sovereign tools, guiding others through unjust systems, and ensuring no small business is left defenseless.



### 💡 What Drives Me

**I am driven to uncover uncomfortable insights about the roles Big Tech and government play in oppressing human freedom—especially in how they control, exploit, and profit from data.**

- **Bridging Science and Spirituality:** I’m fascinated by the intersection of data science and spirituality, exploring how meaningful insights from datasets can drive both personal and collective transformation.  
- **Big Data Enthusiast:** I enjoy working with large-scale platforms like Hadoop and Snowflake to uncover patterns, optimize decision-making, and support sovereign infrastructure.  
- **Creativity in Analytics:** For me, analytics is both an art and a science. I take pride in designing visually engaging dashboards and tools that make complex information intuitive and actionable for all users.


### 🎯 My Goals

- To help small businesses across America first, than globally, reclaim their greatness through true sovereignty—owning their data, decisions, and direction.  
- Contribute to projects that address pressing societal challenges, including climate change, economic justice, and spiritual well-being.  
- Collaborate on open-source initiatives that challenge the status quo and expand the frontiers of data-driven innovation.  
- Continue growing as a data professional while staying rooted in my core values: curiosity, integrity, and purposeful collaboration.
